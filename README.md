# Quran align player
A Quran sound player that prints the currently pronounced words based on input from [Quran-align](https://github.com/cpfair/quran-align) files and sound from [Every Ayah](http://everyayah.com) recitations.

I used the files provided in the Quran-align repo without any modification. The main purpose of this player is to present how to use the file and builds a little on top of it.

Each pronounced segment is printed to the console.

## Dependencies
- Java 8
- JavaFX
- Gson [repo](https://github.com/google/gson)
